== Software Defined Radio Telescope ==
A software defined radio telescope developed as part of my dissertation during a MSc in Computing degree at the link:http://www.wit.ie[Waterford Institute of Technology], Ireland.

=== Antenna Design ===
The antenna design is a dual dipole antenna which offers 10, 15 or 20ft configurations which offers the means to
aim the antenna at multiple points in the sky. The system is aided further with the use of phasing cables. For
more information see the http://radiojove.gsfc.nasa.gov/telescope/ant_manual.pdf[NASA Radio Jove Antenna Manual].

\cite{belcher87}

This is typically an outline description detailing the background	 to the problem.

\section{Scope}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Scope}
Students should identify whether the research outcomes are likely to have universal application or have a defined scope. This is important in gauging the extent to which the work is capable of independent replication.

Due to the latitude of Ireland being 53.3 degrees N, the telescope configuration will apply only to locations at this or a similar latitude, but will be universally applicable at this latitude.

\section{Research Questions}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Research Questions}
A clear, precise definition of the problem is very important to focus on the research activity. great care should be used in devising the research questions. They define the structure of the investigation/innovation that will be used and an essential metric of the quality of the dissertation is the degree to which the research question has/have been answered.

 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Do amateur radio emissions adversely affect radio astronomy in the 15m band?
  \item What can be done using software defined radio to filter local radio interference from radio astronomy observations?
  \item How cheaply can a fully automated radio telescope listening station be built using current IOT technologies?
\end{itemize}

%
\newpage
%
\section{Methodology}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Methodology}
This should outline the approach and methodology being proposed by the student to address the research question.

%
\newpage
%
\section{Preliminary Literature Review}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Preliminary Literature Review}
This should contain a review of a number of books, journal articles and web references of relevance to the research area proposed. The literature should contain seminal and recent referenced research material that is categorised under a number of relevant sub-themes.

WIP:

I've read about 15 papers already related to the background of the interactions between Jupiter and Io, and papers detailing results from similar telescopes to the design I intend to build. I've hit a paywall on some of the earliest seminal papers which were the first to detail the phenomenon of decametric emissions being emitted by the Jupiter-Io system. I will attempt to get a copy through the inter library loan system at WIT.

\section{Contribution to Research Knowledge Anticipated}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Contribution to Research Knowledge Anticipated}
%
A dissertation is a work of scholarly investigation that is grounded in the research literature and differs from a report or a book. It is judged on a prescribed set of academic criteria. Although the likely outcomes are tentative at hte start of the program, it is useful to incorporate them into the research proposal to help focus the work program.

%
\newpage
%
\section{Description of the Experimental Design / Validation Methodology}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Description of the Experimental Design / Validation Methodology}
%
A dissertation must employ rigorous scientific argument. The experimental design and the validation methodology must be specified in great detail in the proposal. At this proposal stage you should define clear evaluation criteria.

%
\newpage
%
\section{Special Resources Required}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Special Resources Required}
%
The research work may require access to specialised equipment, software, journals and so on.

Access to the HackRF or another similar SDR is required.
Access to the RadioJove Prediction software

\section{Main Milestones Anticipated}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Main Milestones Anticipated}
%
Students should agree a number of milestones and their likely delivery dates with their supervisor at the start of the progress.


\begin{itemize}
  \item Design the testbed
  \item Build the telescope
  \item Perform a site survey with the spectrum analyser
  \item Replicate the testbed at a second site
\end{itemize}

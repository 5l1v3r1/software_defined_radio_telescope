%
It was discovered in 1954 by \cite{burke55} that the planet Jupiter emits radio transmissions in the decameter (\gls{DAM}) range \textit{(10-100 m wavelengths)}, and the inner Jovian satellite Io appeared to have a strong control effect on these emissions \citep{belcher87}. Jupiter's radio emissions range between 4 MHz to 40 MHZ while emitting most strongly at 8 MHz  \citep{wilkinson94}. Due to interference from human short wave radio sources between 4-15 MHz coupled with the attenuation of these signals below 8 MHz or the refraction off Earths ionosphere, the majority of emissions have been observed up in the 15-25 MHz range where this interference is less \citep{wilkinson94}. The emission signal strength quickly diminishes above this range for ground based listening sites \citep{wilkinson94}.

Data collected by the two Voyager spacecraft in 1979 \citep{belcher87} and the later Galileo mission in 1995 \citep{kivelson96} added hugely to the understanding of the plasma interactions between Jupiter and Io and the source of the \gls{DAM} emissions. It was discovered that the Io has a thin atmosphere made up of a number of neutral gasses namely sodium, potassium, sulfur, and oxygen as shown in Figure. \ref{fig:io_neutral_gasses}. It is generally thought these gasses have been emitted through volcanic activity on the surface of the moon \citep{belcher87}. The gasses in orbit of Io have a very short life time, due to collisions with magnetospheric electrons. This gives rise to a plasma torus (\gls{IPT}) which corotates with Jupiter itself \citep{belcher87}. This can also be seen in Figure. \ref{fig:io_neutral_gasses} which shows the \gls{IPT}.

\label{fig:io_flux_tube}
\end{figure}
%

The local corotation speed of the plasma torus is faster than the Keplerian orbit of the moon, and the plasma overtakes Io in its orbit at \begin{math} 57 km\;s^{-1} \end{math} \citep{belcher87}. Figures \ref{fig:io_flux_tube} and \ref{fig:io_flux_tube_plasma_torus} detail diagrams of the Io Flux Tube (\gls{IFT}) which is a cylinder shaped tube of space containing Jovian magnetic field lines \citep{belcher87} which link Io to Jupiters ionosphere at both poles. A large portion of the decametric emissions come from the area where this \gls{IFT} meets the Jovian ionosphere \citep{belcher87}. 

As Io orbits within this flux torus it acts as a unipolar conductor \citep{bose08}, and Alfv\'en waves are regularly produced which carry an electric charge along the magnetic field lines between Io and Jupiter \citep{bose08}.

 These Alfv\'en waves reflect between Jupiters ionosphere at both north and south poles and Io upto 9 times \citep{bose08} while following Io through its orbit, thereby acting as a standing wave \citep{bose08}. It appears the source of the \gls{DAM} emissions are largely due to these reflections of the Alfv\'en waves off Jupiter's ionosphere in both the northern and southern regions \citep{bose08}. See Figure. \ref{fig:io_plasma_torus} which shows the Alfv\'en wings reflecting from Jupiters Ionosphere creating emission cones. 

The \gls{DAM} emissions are carried along the surface of the emission cones as show in Figure. \ref{fig:io_flux_tube} \citep{belcher87}. When Io is at specific points in its orbit of Jupiter, emissions travelling along the surface of these emission cones are pointing in the direction of Earth, at which point they can be picked up at ground based radio telescope listening stations.

A ground based listening station aiming to record \gls{DAM} emissions from Jupiter is most likely to succeed between 15-25 MHz \citep{wilkinson94}. According to \cite{arrl-00} there is no clear definition of the \textit{shortwave} radio bands however it is most often considered to extend from 3 MHz to 30 MHz. ComReg is the Irish Commission for Communications Regulation within Ireland, and maintains a list of the short wave frequencies which are designated for transmission purposes in Ireland and can be seen in Figure. \ref{fig:irish_electromagnetic_transmission_ranges} \citep{comreg14}.

%
\begin{figure}[here]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{images/06}
\caption{Irish Regulatory Transmission Ranges \citep{comreg14}}
\label{fig:irish_electromagnetic_transmission_ranges}
\end{figure}
%

As many commercial shortwave radio stations transmit in the lower end of the high frequency (\gls{HF}) 3-7 MHz range, it can be extremely busy and potentially difficult to monitor \gls{DAM} emissions where they are strongest. Amateur Radio operators also operate frequently in mid-late \gls{HF} ranges (\textit{160m, 80m, 60m, 40m, 30m, 20m, 17m, 15m, 12m and 10m bands}) while the higher frequency \gls{DAM} emissions taper off in strength very quickly. This limits the potential listening range significantly. Despite these obstacles, there are sections of the \gls{HF} spectrum which are suitable to capture Jovian emissions. A suitable frequency to monitor Jovian \gls{DAM} emissions which is recommended by the Radio Jove project is \textit{20.1 MHz} \citep{nasa12}. 

Sourcing a suitable antenna is one of the first requirements to satisfy in order to capture \gls{DAM} emissions. Antennas are generally best suited to collect electromagnetic radiation at single specific frequencies, but may resonate and therefore operate over a range of frequencies depending on the design \citep{nasa12}. The wavelength ($\lambda$) which corresponds with the frequency (\textit{f}) \textit{20.1 MHz} can be obtained using the wavelength equation as shown in fig \ref{fig:wavelength_equation}. The corresponding wavelength for the frequency \textit{20.1 MHz} works out to be \textit{14.925 m} using this equation.

%
\begin{figure}[here]
  \centering
  \begin{equation}  	
    \lambda = \frac{c}{f}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
    \lambda = \frac{3\times10^8 m/s}{20.1\times10^6 Hz} = 14.925373134328359 m
  \end{equation}
  \caption{Wavelength Equation}
  \label{fig:wavelength_equation}
\end{figure}
%

One simple antenna design for collecting \gls{DAM} emissions is the \textit{dipole}. A dipole antenna can be constructed simply and cheaply from two pieces of wire and three insulators \citep{nasa12}, while ensuring to cut the wires to a length matching half the desired wavelength being captured \citep{nasa12}. However as the formula referenced in Figure. \ref{fig:wavelength_equation} describes the use of an \textit{infinitely thin} wire which is not possible in reality, \textit{capacitive end effects} must be taken into account when working out the resonating wavelength for a dipole antenna \citep{nasa12}.

The formula for calculating the resonating frequency for a half wavelength dipole is described in fig \ref{fig:wavelength_equation_dipole} and produces the value which should measure from tip to tip on the wires used to construct the dipole antenna \citep{nasa12}. \cite{RSGB-14} states in practice that the true resonance is not exactly multiples of the half-wavelength due to factors such as the coatings on the wire and loss due to radiation. A second formula is detailed in Figure. \ref{fig:wavelength_equation_wire_antenna} which takes these factors into account and produces an antenna length which is slightly larger than the formula proposed by \citep{nasa12}. Formula. 4 \textit{n} stands for the number of half-wavelengths in the antenna.

The radio emissions come in several different forms each with slightly different characteristics. Table. \ref{tab:dam_emissions} shows a list of the more widely known types which can be picked up using ground based listening equipment, and also has some information about their different characteristics \citep{wilkinson94}. Any particular observation session might be made up of some or all of these different types of \gls{DAM} emission and can last from a few minutes to several hours for larger noise storms \citep{wilkinson94}.

\newglossaryentry{SDR}
{
  name={SDR},
  description={Software Defined Radio is the creation of radio functions within software rather than as previously using hardware},
  sort=SDR
}

The aim of this project is to design and construct a low cost, self sufficient software defined radio (\gls{SDR}) telescope listening station, which can capture signals for transmission to a central data aggregation point for signal processing and analysis. This telescope should be suitable to study signals  in the \gls{DAM} (10-100 m) band at or near the \textit{20.1 MHz} frequency in order to pick up emissions produced by either Jupiter or the Sun.

There are a number of challenges which need to be overcome to achieve this, such as Jupiter only being visible for a number of months each year and then generally in the evening, night, or morning hours. Often at highly unsociable times. For this reason a radio telescope listening site should be as automated as possible.

%
\begin{figure}[here]

\caption{Dual Dipole Antenna Beam at 20FT and 135deg phasing S \citep{nasa12}}
\label{fig:dual_dipole_20ft_135phasing_s}
\end{figure}
%

During daylight hours, the ionosphere becomes opaque to signals in the \gls{DAM} band due to becoming ionised by solar radiation \citep{nasa-ionosphere-12}. The proposed system will have a short window in the order of 1-6 hours every second night and early morning or so during which it may be possible to capture \gls{DAM} emissions from Jupiter. The Sun is a source of \gls{DAM} emissions also, and the telescope can capture solar storm emissions without modification, providing the Sun passes through the antenna beam. The telescope may require manual reconfiguration in order to pick up solar storm emissions during the day.

\end{figure}
%

Interference from human sources such as shortwave radio stations or amateur radio operators are also likely to affect the collection of \gls{DAM} emissions from Jupiter. The ability for automated flagging or removal of interference would be a desirable feature of the system. Lightning storms can also produce interference which will affect observations, it might be desirable for the system to handle natural interference sources also.

\subsection*{Problem Summary}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Problem Summary}

To summarise the problem briefly:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Design of a low cost self sufficient SDR telescope platform suitable for amateur observers
  \item Capable of studying Jupiter in the decametric band 3MHz - 40MHz (10-100 m)
  \item This band is chosen because Earths atmosphere is transparent at these frequencies during the night time
  \item Another reason is emissions near 20Mhz, are least likely to be interfered with from human short wave sources
  \item Such a platform has a second capability in that it is also be capable of studying Solar emissions during the day as solar emissions are strong enough to penetrate the ionosphere during the day
  \item Development of a backhaul system for processing and storage of listening site captured data, thereby making it capable of aggregating data from multiple listening sites
  \item Develop an API for accessing this data, and allow integrating into 3rd party applications
  \item Amateur listening sites can compliment larger telescope arrays around the world
\end{itemize}

%A clear, precise definition of the problem is very important to focus on the research activity. great care should be used in devising the research questions. They define the structure of the investigation/innovation that will be used and an essential metric of the quality of the dissertation is the degree to which the research question has/have been answered.
The initial research questions which arise are as follows:

{
  name={IOT},
  description={Internet of Things a buzzword for everything connecting to everything},
  sort=IOT
}
%

\begin{itemize}
  \item What current Internet of Things (\gls{IOT}) technologies would best suit the development of a fully automated software defined radio signal listening station and how cheaply can it be created?
  \item Can a software defined radio solution be developed to filter or flag known instances of human radio interference from radio signal observations?
  \item If so can this same solution be used to filter or flag known instances of natural radio interference such as lightning?
  \item Can a software defined radio solution be developed to flag possible instances of the three main \gls{DAM} emission types detailed in Table. \ref{tab:dam_emissions} ?
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section*{Research Hypothesis}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Research Hypothesis}
%This should outline the approach and methodology being proposed by the student to address the research question.

The section aims to document the different methodologies which will be followed on this project and is broke up into the following:

\begin{description}
  \item[Antenna Build] \hfill \\
    Building the antenna is further broken down into the following steps:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item source materials to build a dual dipole antenna
      \item build the telescope antenna
      \item validate the antenna is capable of collecting signals at or near the 20.1 MHz frequency \\
    \end{itemize}
  \item [Analysis of Listening Site Suitability] \hfill \\
    Finding a site suitable to deploy the antenna will require a site survey with the antenna connected to a spectrum analyser.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item source a spectrum analyser suitable for performing a site survey
      \item perform the survey at this site
      \item repeat until suitable site is found 
      \item deploy the antenna at a site \\
    \end{itemize}
  \item [Data Collection] \hfill \\
    Jupiter is visible above the horizon at night only during certain periods see Figure. \ref{fig:dual_dipole_antenna_array_beam}. In order to perform the required data collection it is highly desirable to automate the process.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item create listening schedule during which \gls{DAM} emissions are likely to occur
      \item develop \gls{SDR} prototype mechanism for gathering raw data from the antenna
      \item develop software scheduling system which to activate the collection of data from the antenna remotely\\
    \end{itemize}
  \item [Data Analysis] \hfill \\
    Collected data can be analysed manually at first in order to validate the testbed, but later using software such as the development of basic algorithms to spot events such as \textit{S-Bursts} occurring in the data.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item analyse data collected for evidence of Jovian or Solar \gls{DAM} emissions
      \item analyse data for evidence of interference from human sources
      \item analyse data for evidence of interference from natural sources
      \item develop a system which connects to the dxspider server and creates flag events for human identified emissions at or near the target frequency being monitored by the telescope
      \item develop a system which interacts with the Blitzortung servers and creates flag events for emissions generated by lightning \\
    \end{itemize}
  \item [Data Processing] \hfill \\
    \gls{SDR} data processing techniques can be developed in order to better filter the signals as they are being collected thereby minimising the level of processing at a later stage.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item using \gls{SDR} techniques, to reduce interference in data as it is being collected
      \item attempt to remove instances of human and natural interference using signal processing techniques after collection \\
    \end{itemize}
  \item [Data Aggregation] \hfill \\
    An API layer allows 3rd parties the ability to access data collected from multiple listening sites and potentially develop new features or systems using the data.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item develop API layer to allow external parties access aggregated data collected by the system \\
    \end{itemize}
  \item [Design Platform] \hfill \\
    An analysis of the current available \gls{IOT} technologies and some of the available options which could be used in order to produce an open low cost platform which amateur astronomers could use in order to study emissions in the \gls{DAM} band.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item design a self sufficient automated platform suitable for collection of signals such as those by the \gls{SDR} telescope \\
    \end{itemize}
\end{description}

The \gls{SDR} hardware transceiver used is likely to be the \textit{HackRF} system while the \gls{SDR} software components will be developed in either \textit{C++} or \textit{Python} as both languages have bindings for the \textit{GNURadio} development toolkit \citep{gnuradio-14}. The backend aggregation system with API will most likely be developed in the \textit{Ruby} language as this language is highly expressive and suitable for rapid prototype development. Execution of the Ruby application on the Java VM is capable using the \textit{JRuby} system, which will also allow the incorporation of any required Java libraries.


\subsection*{Potential Pitfalls}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Potential Pitfalls}
%Predecisions on how I want to collect data, creating the research questions

It is difficult to determine at this early stage what will ultimately prove to be the most troublesome element to implement, however there are a number of potential pitfalls which have already been identified.

%
\begin{figure}[here]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{images/11}
\caption{Radio Jove Graph Showing Jupiters Max Altitude 2014 \citep{rjp-14}}
\label{fig:jupiter_max_altitude_2014}
\end{figure}
%

The latitude of Ireland is 53.3$^{\circ}$ degrees N. In Ireland Jupiter reaches a maximum altitude of 52$^{\circ}$ degrees in 2014 see Figure. \ref{fig:jupiter_max_altitude_2014}. The telescope configuration which will be documented will apply only to locations at this or a similar latitude. It will be universally applicable at this latitude without modification throughout the world, and with relatively minor modifications to the configuration of the antenna it can be used at all locations. \cite{nasa12}

The \gls{SDR} complexity of the solution required in order to correctly filter interference might ultimately prove too resource intensive to work with a low power system such as the \textit{Raspberry Pi} or \textit{Beaglebone Black}. It might become apparent that the minimum system requirements may need to be increased to an \textit{Intel Atom} powered Netbook for example, or potentially something a lot more powerful such as an \textit{i3} or \textit{i5} system. If this was the case, it will drastically increase the power and cost requirements of the system should it be self sufficient, requiring bigger batteries, more capable/expensive photovoltaic and or wind turbines to keep the system topped up.

\section*{Preliminary Literature Review}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Preliminary Literature Review}
%This should contain a review of a number of books, journal articles and web references of relevance to the research area proposed. The literature should contain seminal and recent referenced research material that is categorised under a number of relevant sub-themes.

The preliminary literature review can be broken down into the following areas:


\begin{itemize}
  \item[\textbullet] What are the decametric radio emissions and what are they caused by
  \item[\textbullet] Potential radio telescope designs which could be replicated in order to collect DAM emissions
  \item[\textbullet] Digital signal processing and filtering to remove interference
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decametric Radio Emission what are they and where do they come from?}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Decametric Radio Emission what are they and where do they come from?}

\cite{belcher87} states that the data collected by both \textit{Voyager} spacecraft fit with the Alfv\'en wing theory as an explanation for the source of the \gls{DAM} emissions \citep{belcher87}. \cite{kivelson96} discusses the refinements made to this theory to take into account the flowing plasma between Jupiters ionosphere and the electrically conducting Io. The \textit{Galileo} spacecraft collected data which appears to corroborate the updates to the Alfv\'en wing model \citep{kivelson96}. \cite{bose08} states that the Alfv\'en waves reflect off Jupiters ionosphere which cause the \gls{DAM} emissions to radiate out from the point in Jupiters ionosphere where it meets the \gls{IFT} in a cone shape. \cite{imai-08} proposes an update to this model to take into account the decade long shifts in \gls{DAM} emission patterns, and proposes an extension to the emission cone model to include a \textit{searchlight} shaped emission zone \citep{imai-08} see Figure. \ref{fig:decametric_emissions_searchlight}.

\subsection*{Radio Telescope Designs, Which to Choose?}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Radio Telescope Designs, Which to Choose?}
The NASA project \textit{Radio Jove} recommended the dual dipole array design for a cheap low cost listening site as shown in Figure. \ref{fig:dual_dipole_antenna_array} \citep{nasa12}. But it is by no means the only antenna design which would be capable of picking up the \gls{DAM} emissions. \cite{wilkinson94} recommends a slightly more advanced design, the \textit{folded dipole} which maximises the bandwidth available to the antenna \citep{wilkinson94}. \cite{greef-12} details a third alternative for collecting \gls{DAM} emissions, a shortwave loop antenna as can be seen in Figures. \ref{fig:loop_antenna_design_a}, \ref{fig:loop_antenna_design_b} and \ref{fig:loop_antenna_design_c}.

\subsection*{Digital Signal Processing}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Digital Signal Processing}
\cite{freidt-13} holds that digital signal processing is the preferred means to process signals, for reasons such as stability and for its resistance to long term ageing effects that analogue systems suffer from. Due to the cheap availability of computational resources, digital signal processing is capable of being carried out now within software entirely, this has led to the development of software defined radio solutions \citep{freidt-13}. The GNURadio software allows creation of software defined radio solutions by replacing hardware functions with modular software functions. These software functions are capable of being connected together, an output from one function providing input for another. It is in this fashion it is possible to transform digital signals using digital signal processing methods \citep{gnuradio-14}.

\section*{Antenna Build}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Antenna Build}

\newglossaryentry{SWR}
{
  name={SWR},
  description={Standing Wave Ratio is the ratio of impedance between receiver and antenna},
  sort=SWR
}

In order to satisfy the main requirement of capturing \gls{DAM} signals at 20.1MHz construction of an antenna was needed. The equation shown in Figure: \ref{fig:wavelength_equation_wire_antenna} was used to calculate a starting estimate of the length of antenna wire required to construct this antenna. Many factors can affect the ability of an antenna to receive data at a particular frequency \citep{arrl-00}, such as the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item quality of the wire conductor or thickness of the wire
	\item height that the antenna is mounted above the ground
	\item capacitive end effects
	\item closeness to radio conductors
\end{itemize}

One simple method of partly improving antenna performance is by controlling the length of the antenna wire while measuring the Standing Wave Ratio (\gls{SWR}) value, which is the ratio of impedance between the receiver and the antenna. The use of a \gls{SWR} analyser becomes invaluable in this process.

%
\begin{figure}[here]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{images/34}
\caption{Measuring the SWR of the antenna with an SWR Analyser}
\label{fig:swr_analyser_measuring_antenna}
\end{figure}
%

The initial length of antenna wire was cut to match the length produced by the equation in Figure: \ref{fig:wavelength_equation_wire_antenna} and was then cut in half before each end was connected to a dipole center. The antenna was placed on the ground before being connected to the \gls{SWR} analyser. The \gls{SWR} value for the antenna was measured, and it was discovered the antenna was suitable for capturing of signals at 18MHz. The antenna was then shortened by a small identical amount on each side and the \gls{SWR} values were again measured until the antenna registered as being most suitable for operation at 20.1MHz as seen in Figure:  \ref{fig:swr_analyser_measuring_antenna}. 

The \gls{SWR} equations shown in Figure: \ref{fig:swr_equation} is the  equations where $|\rho|$ is the reflection coefficient, P$_{f}$ is the power in the forward wave entering the antenna while P$_{r}$ is the power of the reflected wave in the antenna \citep{arrl-00}.

%
\begin{figure}[here]
  \centering
  \begin{equation}
  	SWR = \frac{1 + |\rho|}{1 - |\rho|} 
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
  	|\rho| = \frac{SWR - 1}{SWR + 1} 
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
  	|\rho| = \sqrt{\frac{P_r}{P_f}}
  \end{equation}
  \caption{Standing Wave Ratio Equations}

%

%
\begin{figure}[here]
  \centering
  \begin{equation}
  	|\rho| = \frac{1.2 - 1}{1.2 + 1} 
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
  	|\rho| = 0.09090909090909088
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
  	0.09090909090909088 = \sqrt{\frac{P_r}{100}}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
  	0.09090909090909088^2 = \frac{P_r}{100}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
  	P_r = 0.826446280991735
  \end{equation}
  \caption{Calculating P$_{r}$ for the antenna}
  \label{fig:swr_equation_pr}
\end{figure}
%

The value of \gls{SWR} for the antenna should be ideally as close as possible to 1, this ensures all the signal energy collected by the antenna is transferred to the load successfully. However in practice this is never the case as all antennas have varying amounts of loss. The antenna once mounted had a measured \gls{SWR} value of 1.2 which equates to a P$_{r}$ value as shown in Figure: \ref{fig:swr_equation_pr} of 0.826446280991735 which is a loss of 17.35\% or about 1dB which is considered reasonable \citep{arrl-00}.

\section*{Listening Site Suitability}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Listening Site Suitability}
A convenient location for the antenna deployment was selected and the antenna was deployed. It was necessary to determine if this site was in fact a suitable location to host a radio telescope antenna. In order measure the ambient noise at the site, a Tektronics SA2600 spectrum analyser was connected to the antenna and left for 2 hours at midday to gather data. The spectrum is likely to be full of radio interference from human and natural sources at this time. The results can be seen in Figure: \ref{fig:site_survey_spec_analyser}. The ambient \gls{RF} noise at the site was quite high, ranging between -80dB and -70dB on average. 

\newglossaryentry{preamp}
{
  name={preamp},
  description={preamplifier - is an electronic amplifier that prepares a small electrical signal for further amplification or processing},
  sort=preamp
}

Similar readings were taken using the HackRF while attached to the antenna as show in Figure: \ref{fig:site_survey_hackrf}. The measurements recorded with the HackRF were performed using the \textit{gqrx} \gls{SDR} software while all amplification settings inside \textit{gqrx} were set at 0, in order to get an accurate reading on the raw signal being collected by the antenna. The values were on average -20dB quieter than those recorded by the SA2600 spectrum analyser, this points towards an inherent deafness flaw in the HackRF design itself, and possibly the requirement of a preamplifier (\gls{preamp}) in order to boost the gain on the input signal.

In May 2013, the Solar Physics Group from Trinity College Dublin, performed a site survey at Birr Castle to assertain the suitability of the site for an installation of the Low Frequency Array (\gls{LOFAR}) telescope \citep{craf-13}. The study was focused on a wide range of frequencies between 10 and 400MHz, a portion of which can be seen in Figure: \ref{fig:site_survey_lofar}. The report concluded that the location at Birr Castle was a relatively quiet location as compared against a site at Bornim, Germany and another at Bleien, Switzerland. 

From the results of this survey, it can be seen that the average background noise levels were about -55dB near 20MHz which is similar to those recorded 80km away at the Kilkenny site. Table: \ref{tab:site_survey} details the results collected at the Kilkenny site and also includes those performed by the Solar Physics Group at Birr Castle for comparison. Results indicate the Kilkenny site appears to be a reasonable location at which to host the radio telescope.

The contributions to research knowledge which are anticipated are listed as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item A low cost and scalable radio telescope listening platform design which Amateur astronomers can use to collaborate on radio astronomical research.
  \item A rudimentary \gls{SDR} solution to filter or flag human and natural radio interference from observations.
  \item An \gls{SDR} solution to flag possible Jovian or Solar radio emissions such as those listed in Table. \ref{tab:dam_emissions}.
